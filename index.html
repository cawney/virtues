    <h1>Explaining 13 Virtues</h1>
    <p>Ever since I read Benjamin Franklin's biography, I've really been fascinated with his 13 virtues. Every day he tried to practice these 13 virtues. If he felt he lived up to his reputation for each one for that day, he would put a black dot on that day and virtue. The goal was to fill his calendar with black dots that corresponded with his virtues.</p>
    <p>These are his 13 virtues, but hopefully I'll learn enough to figure out a way for this to make it my own and change the virtues to something personal to me.</p>
